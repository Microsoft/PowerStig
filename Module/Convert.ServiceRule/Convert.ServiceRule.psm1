    .SYNOPSIS
        Convert the contents of an xccdf check-content element into a ServiceRule object
    .DESCRIPTION
        The ServiceRule class is used to extract the Service settings from the
        check-content of the xccdf. Once a STIG rule is identified a service rule,
        it is passed to the ServiceRule class for parsing and validation.
    .PARAMETER ServiceName
        The service name
    .PARAMETER ServiceState
        The state the service should be in
    .PARAMETER StartupType
        The startup type of the service
    .PARAMETER Ensure
        A present or absent flag

            Gets the service startup type from the xccdf content and sets the

            status is set to  fail.

    <#
        .SYNOPSIS
            Splits a rule into multiple checks
        .DESCRIPTION
            Once a rule has been found to have multiple checks, the rule needs
            to be split. This method splits a services into multiple rules. Each
            split rule id is appended with a dot and letter to keep reporting
            per the ID consistent. An example would be is V-1000 contained 2
            checks, then SplitMultipleRules would return 2 objects with rule ids
            V-1000.a and V-1000.b
        .PARAMETER CheckContent
            The rule text from the check-content element in the xccdf
