      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Poorly planned or implemented changes to the AD schema could cause the applications that rely on AD (such as web and database servers) to operate incorrectly or not all.

Improper changes to the schema could result in changes to AD objects that are incompatible with correct operation of the Windows domain controller and the domain clients. This could cause outages that prevent users from logging on or accessing Windows server resources across multiple hosts.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Manager&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;DCPR-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>

      <RawString>1. Interview the IAO.

2. Obtain a copy of the site’s configuration management procedures documentation.

3. Verify that there is a local policy that requires changes to the directory schema to be processed through a configuration management process. This applies to directory schema changes whether implemented in a database or other types of files. For AD, this refers to changes to the AD schema.

4. If there is no policy that requires changes to the directory schema to be processed through a configuration management process, then this is a finding.

dsquery * "cn=Directory Service,
cn=Windows NT,cn=Services,cn=Configuration,dc=[forest-name]" -scope base -attr * 

(Where dc=[forest-name] is the fully qualified LDAP name of the root of the domain being reviewed.)

Example:
The following is an example of the dsquery command for the vcfn.ost.com forest.

dsquery * "cn=Directory Service,cn=Windows  NT,cn=Services,cn=Configuration,  dc=vcfn,dc=ost,dc=com -scope base -attr * 

2. If the dsHeuristics attribute is listed, note the assigned value.

3. If the dsHeuristics attribute is defined and has a “2” as the 7th character, then this is a finding.

Examples of values that would be a finding as follows:
 “0000002”, “0010002”, “0000002000001”.
(The 7th character controls anonymous access.)

Supplementary Notes:
Domain controllers have this option disabled by default. However, this check verifies that the option has not been enabled.

The dsHeuristics option can be configured with the Windows Support Tools Active Directory Service Interfaces Editor (ADSI Edit) console (adsiedit.msc).</RawString>

    <Rule id="V-8557" severity="medium" conversionstatus="pass" title="Time Synchronization-Authoritative Source" dscresource="None">
      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;When the Windows Time service is used to synchronize time on client computers (workstations and servers) throughout an AD forest, the forest root domain PDC Emulator is the normal default to provide the authoritative time source for the entire forest. To obtain an accurate time for itself, the forest root domain PDC Emulator acts as a client to an external time source.

If the Windows Time service on the forest root domain PDC Emulator is not configured to acquire the time from a proper source, it may cause time service clients throughout the forest to operate with the inaccurate time setting.

When a Windows computer operates with an inaccurate time setting, access to resources on computers with the accurate time might be denied. This is notably true when Kerberos authentication is utilized. Operation with an inaccurate time setting can reduce the value of audit data and invalidate it as a source of forensic evidence in an incident investigation.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>

      <RawString>This applies to the domain controller with the PDC emulator role in forest root domain; it is NA for other domain controllers in the forest.

Determine the domain controller with the PDC Emulator role in the forest root domain:

Windows 2008 R2 or later: 

Open "Windows PowerShell".

Enter "Get-ADDomain -Identity [Forest Root Domain] | FT PDCEmulator", where [Forest Root Domain] is the forest root domain name, such as "example.mil". (This can also be entered without the -Identity parameter if running within the forest root domain.)

Windows 2008:

Open "Active Directory Users and Computers" from a domain controller in or connected to the forest root (available from various menus or run "dsa.msc").

Select "Action" in the menu, then "All Tasks &gt;&gt; Operations Masters".

Select the "PDC" tab.

On the system with the PDC Emulator role, open "Windows PowerShell" or an elevated "Command Prompt" (run as administrator).

Enter "W32tm /query /configuration".

Under the "NtpClient" section:

If the value for "Type" is not "NTP", this is a finding.

If the value for "NtpServer" is not an external DoD time source, this is a finding.

If an alternate time synchronization tool is used and is not enabled or not configured to a synchronize with an external DoD time source, this is a finding.

The US Naval Observatory operates stratum 1 time servers, identified at http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/ntp.html. Time synchronization will occur through a hierarchy of time servers down to the local level. Clients and lower-level servers will synchronize with an authorized time server in the hierarchy.</RawString>

Supplemental Notes:
If the Schema management console has not already been configured on the computer, create a console by using the following:

The steps for adding the snap-in may vary depending on the Windows version.
Register the required DLL module by typing the following at a command line "regsvr32 schmmgmt.dll".
Run "mmc.exe" to start a Microsoft Management Console. 
Select Add/Remove Snap-in from the File menu.
From the Available Standalone Snap-ins list, select Active Directory Schema
Select the Add button.
Select the OK button.

When done using the console, select Exit from the File (or Console) menu.
Select the No button to the Save console settings… prompt (unless the SA wishes to retain this console). If the console is retained, the recommended name is schmmgmt.msc and the recommended location is the [systemroot]\system32 directory.</RawString>
