# PowerStig Style Guidelines

We have adopted the style guidelines from the PowerShell DSC Resource repository. Most of these styles guidelines are enforced with tests that we automatically run from the DscResource.Tests repository. To review the style guidelines, please visit [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/blob/master/StyleGuidelines.md).
