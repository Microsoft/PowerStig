.SYNOPSIS
    This class describes a Technology

.DESCRIPTION
    The Technology class describes a Technology, the definition of the abstracted platform of an application or portion of an application that
    the Stig applies to. This could often be a specific type of OS, but is not limited to that. The Technology is one of a few Technology
    focused classes that work together to form a complete description of the Stig required by the user or application creating the StigData
    instance.

.EXAMPLE
    $technology = [Technology]::new([string] $Name)

.NOTES
    This class requires PowerShell v5 or above.
